Aeris iOS Weather SDK 2.0
=============

The [Aeris iOS Weather Framework](http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/) allows a developer to quickly and easily add weather content and functionality to their iOS applications quickly and easily without having to code anything themselves. It utilizes the [Aeris API](http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/) backend for data loading and is built on top of an object mapping system that efficiently loads requested weather content into third-party iOS applications, greatly reducing the amount of code and development needed on the developer end.

### How to Get Started

Check out the included demo project, under the **AerisSDKDemo** directory, which contains a variety of example views using different components of the SDK, including the built-in weather views and weather maps with different mapping libraries. Since the project's dependencies (specifically AFNetworking) in the demo project are installed and managed using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), you will need to open the **AerisSDKDemo/AerisSDKDemo.xcworkspace**.

The various components of the Aeris iOS Weather SDK are located under the **AerisSDK** directory. These are the libraries you will be using within your own custom projects.

For complete details and instructions on installing and getting started with the Aeris iOS Weather SDK, refer to our complete [usage and API documentation](http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/).
